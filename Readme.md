The integration of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) with natural language processing (NLP) has revolutionized how we tackle complex issues and extract insights from textual data. This project aims to automate the analysis of problem statements and classify them into relevant ML paradigms using NLP techniques. It presents a fully automated solution that selects trainable features from problem statements, conducts extensive analyses, and applies supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement learning methodologies as needed. By leveraging NLP, the project ensures that problem statements are effectively understood and mapped to appropriate machine learning models.
The main objective of this project is to process datasets alongside their corresponding problem statements, using NLP to interpret the issue and identify relevant attributes. It automates the selection of trainable input variables and target output variables for model training. To prepare the dataset for modeling, exploratory data analysis (EDA) and preprocessing techniques are applied. The project then develops and evaluates multiple ML and DL models based on the nature of the identified problem. By determining whether a problem requires supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement learning, the system streamlines the decision- making process for selecting an optimal model.

In today's data-driven world, researchers and organizations are frequently overwhelmed by complex problem statements and diverse datasets. Manually interpreting these issues, building appropriate ML models, and assessing their performance is time-consuming and prone to errors. NLP plays a crucial role in automating decision-making and extracting valuable insights from unstructured text data. When combined with ML and DL models, NLP enables scalable and efficient solutions. Automating the workflow from problem understanding to model deployment enhances consistency and reduces development time while ensuring adaptability across different scenarios.
The significance of this project lies in its ability to integrate NLP for issue comprehension, thereby streamlining and automating the machine learning pipeline. This approach minimizes the expertise required for interpreting problem statements and determining appropriate ML paradigms. Additionally, the project enhances efficiency by reducing manual intervention, ensures accuracy through automated feature selection and model evaluation, and promotes reusability by serializing trained models for future applications. The framework is designed to handle various datasets and problem types, making it highly scalable and adaptable.
